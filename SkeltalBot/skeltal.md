-- Overview --
The Mr. Skeltal Bot is a simple Reddit bot to help
me learn the basics of Reddit bots. Essentially, it 
goes through some subreddits, finds if and where the phrase
"Thank Mr. Skeltal" (or some variant) is, and replies with
a variant of "Doot Doot"

It's not that original, but it helps get me acclimated
with developing bots.
